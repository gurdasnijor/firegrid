/**
 * effect-durable-operators
 *
 * Effect-native durable operators on top of `@durable-streams/state` and
 * `@tanstack/db`. The public surface is intentionally minimal:
 *
 *   - DurableTable: ksql-inspired service-tag table with generated
 *     insert/insertOrGet/upsert/delete/get/query/subscribe facades over
 *     createStreamDB.
 *   - DurableTable.primaryKey: a Schema.transform/annotation helper that pins
 *     a struct field's encoded form to string and marks it for AST discovery.
 *   - DurableTableHeaders: shared request header passthrough type for table
 *     layer auth configuration.
 *   - DurableTableError: the typed error for the table primitive.
 *
 * See docs/proposals/SDD_EFFECT_DURABLE_OPERATORS.md.
