/**
 * Contract-coverage seam annotations for runtime-owned `Activity.make` spans.
 *
 * The span named after an Activity (`activity.name`) is created inside vendored
 * `@effect/workflow` `Activity.make` -> `makeExecute`
 * (`repos/effect/packages/workflow/src/Activity.ts`), which wraps the activity
 * body in `Effect.withSpan(effect, activity.name, …)` with no call-site hook for
 * attributes. So a runtime call site cannot attach
 * `firegrid.seam.kind` / `firegrid.contract.id` to that span the normal way
 * (the tf-mmh2 finding).
 *
 * This module is the smallest fully-local hook that closes that gap WITHOUT
 * editing `repos/effect`:
 *
 *  1. `withActivityContract` stashes the seam classification on the Activity
 *     object itself (a non-enumerable Symbol property on the very object that
 *     `makeExecute` closes over and later hands to the engine).
 *  2. `annotateActivityContractSpan` is run by the runtime-owned engine
 *     (`engine-runtime.ts` `activityExecute`) at its entry — i.e. BEFORE the
 *     engine opens its own `firegrid.workflow_engine.activity.execute` span, so
 *     the current span is still the Activity-name span created by `makeExecute`.
 *     `Effect.annotateCurrentSpan` therefore lands the attributes on the
 *     Activity-name span. (Verified: `makeExecute` -> `wrapActivityResult`
 *     [contextWithEffect/onExit, no span] -> `WorkflowEngine` `fnUntraced`
 *     wrapper [no span] -> our `activityExecute`. Our method is the only caller
 *     path, always invoked inside the name span.)
 *
 * Result: runtime-owned activity-name span families carry a resolving
 * `firegrid.contract.id` in regenerated traces, so contract-coverage (`C`)
 * counts them — see `docs/architecture/runtime-shrink-loop.md`.
